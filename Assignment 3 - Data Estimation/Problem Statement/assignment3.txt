This assignment is based on trying to estimate various physical parameters using raw data (from the datasets) and Planck's formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant

In particular, the datasets correspond to the spectral radiance per unit wavelength (wavelength expressed in metres). At first, assume that you do not know any of the parameters T, c, h or k. Try to estimate their values by curve fitting the data. For this you first need to create a Python function that implements the given equation.

The estimates from this are likely to be very poor. As a next step, do "partial application" to create simpler functions that have fewer unknowns (assume values for some of the parameters), so that there is only one unknown at a time. Estimate the parameters and report on your findings.

Submit two files: one PDF that contains a report on your experiments and findings. The other should be either a Python notebook (pynb format) or a Python script (.py). The PDF document should contain clear instructions on how to run and test the code for reproducing the various results.
